# currency-converter
This project is a simple currency converter built using Vite and Tailwind CSS. It demonstrates the usage of custom hooks in React, specifically the useId hook for generating unique IDs, as well as the optimization of code.

Overview
The Currency Converter project showcases the integration of Vite, a fast build tool for modern web development, with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. It aims to provide a simple and efficient solution for converting currencies.

Custom Hooks in React
Creating Custom Hooks
In React, custom hooks are functions that allow you to reuse stateful logic across components. To create a custom hook, you can define a function that uses React hooks internally and returns any necessary state or functionality.

Unique Key for JSON Data
In React, when rendering lists of elements, it's important to assign a unique key prop to each element to help React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed. This is particularly important when rendering dynamic data fetched from an API, such as currency options for a select field.
